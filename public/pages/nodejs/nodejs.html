<h1>What is Node?</h1>
<h3>
    Node is an open-source, cross-platform, server-side Javascript runtime enviroment. <br>
    One of it's main features is the ability to use Javascript on the server-side (Backend!). <br>
    This allows for us developers to write the same language both frontend and backend, which can save time and can generally just be easier. <br>
    Node also has a built in package manager called npm (Node Package Manager), which makes it easy to install and manage third party packages and modules! <br>
    Node.js is a service-site-enviroment that allows you to run Javascript on your computer, outside the browser.

<h2>How to Node!</h2>
<h3>
    Node commands are run in the terminal. We've used the terminal provided by our editor for coding so far. <br>
    Theres a few different commands, but most will start with either "node" or "npm". <br>
    The main ones we've used have been:
    <h4>
        "npm install `package-name`" which installs a package. Can be shortened to "i" for install. Also can add "-g" to install globally instead of just inside current folder. <br>

    <h4>
        "npm init" which initializes a new Node.js project and creating a corresponding `package.json` file <br>

    <h4>
        "npm start" to start our application. <br>
        "node run `script-file`" which will start a custom script defined in our package.json file.
