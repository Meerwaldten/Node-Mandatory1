<h1>Difference between client-side and server-side rendering!</h1>
<h2>Client-side rendering:</h2>
<h4>
    Client-side rendering (CSR) means that HTML, CSS and Javascript is downloaded by the clients browser and rendered dynamically as a single-page applicantion (SPA). <br>
    The server sends only the initial HTML and JavaScript needed to load the SPA, 
    and then the client's browser handles all subsequent interactions, rendering new content on the fly using JavaScript. <br>
    CSR is often used in web applications that require a high level of interactivity or that need to fetch data from an API

<h2>Server side rendering:</h2>
<h4>
    Server-side rendering (SSR) means that the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that make up a web page are generated on the server and sent to the client as a complete page. <br>
    The client's browser does not need to do any additional processing to render the page, because the server has already done all the work. <br>
    SSR is often used in web applications that rely heavily on SEO (Search Engine Optimization) or that have complex content that is difficult to render on the client.

<h4>
    In Node.js, we can use frameworks to handle SSR. They help by generating templates on the server and sending them to the client as complete pages. <br>
    The one we've used is Express. Here is an example of how my "templateEngine" helps render the pages. <br>

    For CSR, frameworks that can help could be React and Angular.
