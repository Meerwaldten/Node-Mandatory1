    Functions: <br>
</h2>
<h3>
    A "normal" function:
    <h4> 
        Block of code that can be called by name and executed whenever it is needed. <br>
        Can accept inputs (parameteres) and return output. Decleared by "function" keyword, followed by function name, parameters and code block. <br>
    </h4>

    An anonymous function: 
    <h4>
        A function without a name. It can be assigned to a variable or passed as an argument to another function. Anonymous functions are commonly used as callback functions. 
    </h4>

    A callback function: 
    <h4>
        A callback function is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is executed after some operation has completed. <br>
        It is a way to ensure that code is executed in a specific order, even if some operations take longer than others.
    </h4>

    An arrow function:
    <h4>
        An arrow function is a more concise way to write a function. It uses the => syntax and can be used as a replacement for anonymous functions. <br>
        Arrow functions can be used in the same way as regular functions, but with less code.
    </h4>

    A compact arrow function: 
    <h4>
        A compact arrow function is a further optimization of the arrow function syntax. <br>
        It can be used when the function takes only one argument, and its body is a single expression. <br>
        In this case, the function does not need curly braces or a return statement.
