<h2>
    Variables in Javascript; <br>
</h2>
<h3>
    Which variables exists and what's their pros & cons!
</h3>
<h3>
    "let":
</h3>
    <h4>
        Pros: <br>
        "let" variables are block-scoped; They can only be accessed within the block of code where they are declared. <br>
        They also can't be redeclared within that block, which can prevent errors. - They can however be reassigned! <br>
        Cons: <br>
        They can be harder to access, since they only exists within blocks. <br>
        They also must be declared before being used, which can be annoying. <br>
        Might not be supported in all versions of Javascript. <br>
        When to use: If you have to.

<h3>
    "var":
</h3>
    <h4>
        Pros: <br>
        The orignal way of declaring in Javascript and therefor supported in all versions of Javascript. <br>
        "var "is function-scoped, meaning they can be accessed within the function in which they're decleared. - Also able to be redeclared and reassigned in same scope. <br>
        Cons: <br>
        Can be hoisted, meaning they can be accessed before they're declared which can cause confusion and errors. <br>
        They're not block-scoped, so they can be accessed outside of where they're declared. <br>
        "var" variables can easily be overwritten or redeclared which can lead to unexpected behavior and errors.
        When to use: Never!

    "const":
</h3>
    <h4>
        Pros: <br>
        "const" variables are block-scoped, same as "let". <br>
        They can't be redeclared or reassigned within their scope, which can prevent errors. <br>
        Therefore they're useful for declaring values that shouldn't be changed; constants or configuration settings, etc. <br>
        When to use: Always if you can get away with it!
